# My Dotnet App

This is a simple .NET 7 console application with a corresponding test project.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 7.0 SDK

## Structure

The application is structured into two main folders:

- `src`: This folder contains the console application.
- `tests`: This folder contains the unit tests for the console application.

## Building the Application

To build the application, navigate to the `src` directory and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet build
```

This will compile the application and produce an executable in the `bin` directory.

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the `src` directory and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Running the Tests

To run the unit tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

This will run all the unit tests in the test project and display the results in the console.

## Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying the `appsettings.json` file in the `src` directory. This file is used for configuration settings that the application can read at runtime.
